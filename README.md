# Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project aimed at exploring, analyzing, and visualizing a given dataset. The project utilizes Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (version 3.7 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (optional but recommended for interactive analysis)
- Git (optional for version control)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-project.git

2. Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:cd data-analysis-project
python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
-On Windows:venv\Scripts\activate
-On macOS and Linux:source venv/bin/activate
3. Run Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the analysis notebooks:jupyter notebook

4. Open and Run Notebooks
Open the relevant Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) in the notebooks/ directory to explore and run the analysis.

Project Structure
The project has the following structure:
data-analysis-project/
│
├── data/
│   └── dataset.csv          # The dataset used for analysis
│
├── notebooks/
│   └── analysis.ipynb       # Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
│
├── venv/                    # Virtual environment directory
│
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies

data/: Directory containing the dataset.
notebooks/: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks with the analysis.
venv/: Directory for the virtual environment.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
README.md: This file, providing information about the project.
requirements.txt: File listing the required Python libraries.
LICENSE: The project’s license (optional).

Analysis Overview
The analysis notebook (analysis.ipynb) includes the following sections:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data types, and other preprocessing steps.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating summary statistics and visualizing the data.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data.
Modeling: Building and evaluating machine learning models (if applicable).
Conclusion: Summarizing findings and insights from the analysis.
